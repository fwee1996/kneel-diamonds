ERD NOTES:
Since each style, size, and metal combination represents one piece of jewelry:

Each order can have multiple jewelry, where each jewelry is a combination of a style, size, and metal.
Each customer can place multiple orders, each containing one or more pieces of jewelry.
So the relationships between Orders and Styles, Sizes, and Metals is Many-to-Many Relationship:
Each order in Orders can have multiple pieces of jewelry, which are combinations of styles, sizes, and metals.
Conversely, each style, size, and metal can be associated with multiple orders, as they can be part of different pieces of jewelry in different orders.

Example:

A single order can include multiple pieces of jewelry, each with its own unique combination of style, size, and metal.
Likewise, a style, size, or metal can be used in multiple pieces of jewelry across different orders.
